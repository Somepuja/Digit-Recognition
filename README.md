# Digit-Recognition
Used Three different model for handwritten digit recognition that includes Logistic regression, SVM, and Neural Network.

In my handwritten digit recognition project, I employed a diverse set of machine learning models 
including neural networks, support vector machines (SVM), and logistic regression. By leveraging the strengths of each model, 
I aimed to achieve high accuracy in classifying handwritten digits. Through extensive training on labeled datasets, 
the models were able to learn the patterns and features that distinguish different digits. 
The neural networks offered flexibility and the ability to capture complex relationships, while SVM and logistic regression provided
robust and interpretable classification capabilities. By comparing the performance of these three models, 
I gained valuable insights into their strengths and limitations, contributing to the advancement of handwritten digit recognition techniques.
